# Language
Solution was written in C++

# Most difficult part of assignment
Coming from someone who only knew Java, Python and R prior to this, I found learning C++ while simultaneously trying to learn how to implement the suffix arrays to be very difficult. Also, getting the number of character comparisons correct was very finicky at times. 

# Resources consulted
I googled a lot of C++ syntax. places like stackoverflow and geeksforgeeks helped a lot with simple things like how to create a map, what's the C++ equivalent of java's ArrayList, etc. I also consulted Piazza forums for help with optimization and learning C++ characteristics.
